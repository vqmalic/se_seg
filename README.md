# SE Segmentation

A segmentation model that takes an input image and assigns each pixel a label indicating if that pixel belongs, or does not belong, to a sexually explicit depiction. 

Sexual explicitness is an unavoidably subjective quality. The training data for this model was annotated with the following guidelines:

* Any depicted human designated as a *sexually explicit entity* (SEE) will have the entirety of their bodies, including clothing and paraphenelia, marked as *sexually explicit* (SE). 

* The following conditions mark a depicted human as SEE:
	1. If there is more than one person and they are engaging in any sexual activity (including but not limited coitus, oral sex, or the stimulation of genitals), all participants are considered SEEs.
	2. If a person is exposing any of their genitals or sexualized body parts (including penises, vaginas, breasts, or buttocks), they are considered an SEE. 
	3. If a person is attired or posed in a way that may reasonably construed as intimate or intending to arouse sexual interest, that person is considered an SEE. 
	4. If any object such as a dildo is being used for sexual stimulation, that object is considered an SEE.
